# Crime Data Analysis (2010-2014)
A comprehensive analysis of crime patterns using Python and statistical methods.

## Overview
This project analyzes 5 years of crime data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can inform public safety decisions. The analysis covers temporal patterns, geographic distribution, crime type evolution, and reporting behaviors.

## Features

- Data Quality Assessment: Completeness, uniqueness, and validation metrics
- Temporal Analysis: Crime patterns by hour, day, month, and year
- Geographic Analysis: Hotspot identification and concentration mapping
- Statistical Testing: Trend significance and pattern validation
- Predictive Modeling Prep: Feature engineering and data preparation
- Interactive Dashboard: Comprehensive visual summary

## Quick Start

1. Upload CSV files to Google Colab:

- Crime_Data_2010.csv
- Crime_Data_2011.csv
- Crime_Data_2012.csv
- Crime_Data_2013.csv
- Crime_Data_2014.csv

2. Run the notebook cells sequentially
